# Shono

## Introduction
When you create a real OneApp  module, you don't actually do all of the previous steps manually. Instead, you will use 
Shono to create your module, and all the necessary configurations will be ready for you out-of-the-box.

## What is Shono
Shono is our infra tool for generating and maintaining OneApp modules. When you generate a project using shono, you don't need to manually configure eslint,
typescript, detox etc`, Shpno gives you all the tools that you need already prec-onfigured and working out of the box.

## Getting started

1. Run `npx @wix/shono create` and follow the instructions. It will create a new folder with your new module.
2. Inside your new module dir, run `npx shono -h`. It will show you all the things that you can do with Shono, For example, you can run the app by running- 
`npx shono start`.
3. Go through all the individual commands by running `npx shono <commandName> -h`. For example: `npx shono detox -h`.
4. Go to Shono's repo and scroll down to the `Pro Tips` sections: [Shono](https://github.com/wix-private/shono).
